**Real-time Product Catalog & Chat - Backend:

A Node.js + Express backend with PostgreSQL (Sequelize ORM) and WebSocket (Socket.IO) integration to enable two users to:

View a shared product catalog in real time
Chat with each other (messaging)
Authenticate via mock tokens (JWT based)
Architecture Overview:

Tech Stack:

Backend Framework: Node.js + Express
Database: PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM
Real-time: Socket.IO (WebSockets)
Authentication: JWT (mock tokens for now)
Deployment: Ready for local dev; can be containerized or deployed to Render/Heroku

└── server.js              Entry point: starts server + attaches Socket.IO


Key Files:
.env – Stores environment variables like DB_HOST, JWT_SECRET, etc.
package.json – Lists project dependencies and scripts



 How to Keep It Clean and Professional:
 Group similar responsibilities together (routes, controllers)
Keep business logic separate from Express routes
 Use models + migrations to define and manage your DB schema
 Use Socket.IO in sockets/ for real-time interactions

 Add centralized error handling in middlewares/
